                    <p>
                        Since liberalization of the economy established in 1994, India faces strong international
                        competition. Thus, growth and diversification of its industry are increasingly characterized
                        by a shift from simple to technically complex products.

                        Many enterprises aim at high value-addition. Modernization and automation of production
                        processes increase productivity and reduce unit cost.

                    <p>
                        This is particularly true for the engineering industries (metal and plastics processing
                        ventures) as well as small and medium-scale enterprises (SME). They manufacture
                        tools and molds or use them for producing parts, components, systems, and final
                        products, often as sub-contractors of large enterprises.

                        In recent years the quality of their products and the efficiency of their production
                        processes augmented considerably . Nevertheless, many SME still face constraints.
                        They are related to rapid changes of the market and accelerated technological progress.
